2. Results Page
Displays generated hashtags based on the input keyword:



3Basic Implementation of the Idea

1.Core Logic:
User submits a keyword through the input form.
The application checks the keyword against a predefined dataset to fetch relevant hashtags.
If no matching category exists, it creates generic hashtags (e.g., #keywordLife, #keywordTips).

2.Backend:
Django handles incoming requests and processes the hashtag generation logic.
Predefined datasets stored in the code for simplicity.

3.Frontend:
A minimal HTML page for input and output of hashtags.
Results are dynamically displayed using JavaScript.

#Future Enhancements
Dynamic Hashtag Suggestions: Integrate third-party APIs (Instagram, Twitter) for live trends.
Custom Categories: Allow users to define and save their categories.
Personalization: Enable login functionality for saving commonly used hashtags.
User-Friendly UI: Add a modern and responsive design.
